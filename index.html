        <article>
          <p>tourism, the act and process of spending time away from home in pursuit of recreation, relaxation, and pleasure, while making use of the commercial provision of services. As such, tourism is a product of modern social arrangements, beginning in western Europe in the 17th century, although it has antecedents in Classical antiquity.</p>
          <p>Tourism is distinguished from exploration in that tourists follow a “beaten path,” benefit from established systems of provision, and, as befits pleasure-seekers, are generally insulated from difficulty, danger, and embarrassment. Tourism, however, overlaps with other activities, interests, and processes, including, for example, pilgrimage. This gives rise to shared categories, such as “business tourism,” “sports tourism,” and “medical tourism” (international travel undertaken for the purpose of receiving medical care).</p>

        <header><h2>History</h2></header>
       <article>
        <p>The history of tourism developed mainly through indirect sources in the early period. In India, in the early days of agricultural abundance, export of cash crops created an important trade link. Manufacture of iron-ore into steel for weaponry was another important item of trade by the later Vedic period.</p>
        <p>The first conscious and organized efforts to promote tourism in India were made in 1945 when a committee was set up by the Government under the Chairmanship of Sir John Sargent, the then Educational Adviser to the Government of India (Krishna, A.G., 1993).</p>
        <p>Thereafter, the development of tourism was taken up in a planned manner in 1956 coinciding with the Second Five Year Plan. The approach has evolved from isolated planning of single unit facilities in the Second and Third Five Year Plans.</p>
        <p>The Sixth Plan marked the beginning of a new era when tourism began to be considered a major instrument for social integration and economic development.</p>

              <h3>Taj Mahal</h3>
              <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/IND/india-top-attractions-taj-mahal.jpg" alt="beautiful-Tajmahal">
              <p>Perhaps India's most recognizable building, the Taj Mahal is also the world's most famous testimony to the power of love. Named after Mumtaz Mahal, the favorite wife of Emperor Shah Jahan, this most beautiful of mausoleums was begun upon her death in 1631 and took 20,000 workmen until 1648 to complete.</p>
              <p>Incorporating many elements of Islamic design including arches, minarets, an onion-shaped dome, and black calligraphy inlaid around the entrance, the Taj Mahal is largely constructed of white marble decorated with delicate inlaid floral patterns and precious and semi-precious stones such as jade, lapis lazuli, diamonds, and mother of pearl.</p>
              <code>The Taj Mahal was built by a whopping 22,000 laborers, painters, stonecutters, embroidery artists</code>
            </li>

              <h3>The Holy City of Varanasi</h3>
              <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/IND/india-top-attractions-varanasi.jpg" alt="banaras-city">
              <p>A major pilgrimage center for Hindus, the holy city of Varanasi has long been associated with the mighty Ganges River, one of the faith's most important religious symbols. Dating back to the 8th century BC, Varanasi is one of the oldest still inhabited cities in the world.</p>
              <p>It offers many reasons to visit, not least of them the chance to explore the <b>Old Quarter</b> adjacent to the Ganges where you'll find the <b>Kashi Vishwanath Temple</b>, built in 1780 (the New Vishwanath Temple with its seven separate temples is also of interest).</p>
              <code>Varanasi or Benaras is the oldest living city of the world, it being a chief centre of civilization for more than 3000 years</code>
            </li>

              <h3>Harmandir Sahib: The Golden Temple of Amritsar</h3>
              <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/IND/india-top-attractions-harmandir-sahib.jpg" alt="amritsar-temple">
              <p>Founded in 1577 by Ram Das, Amritsar is an important hub of Sikh history and culture. The main attraction here is Harmandir Sahib, opened in 1604 and still often referred to as the Golden Temple for its beautiful gold decoration. The holiest of India's many Sikh shrines (it also attracts many Hindus and people of other faiths), the temple was built in a blend of Hindu and Islamic styles, its lower marble section featuring such flourishes as ornate inlaid floral and animal motifs, while the large golden dome represents a lotus flower, a symbol of purity to Sikhs.</p>
              <p>In addition to its splendid design, visitors are equally impressed with the temple's spiritual atmosphere, an effect enhanced by the prayers continuously chanted from the Sikh holy book and broadcast throughout the complex. Part of the overall experience-and visitors are welcome to participate-is the chance to enjoy one of the 50,000 free meals the attraction serves up to visitors each and every day.</p>
              <code>The exquisite Golden Temple is a unique blend of the Hindu as well as the Islamic architecture . The shrine is decorated with marble sculptures and paintings that look similar to the Taj Mahal. The dome at the top is made from pure gold and the gurudwara is also encased with intricate gold panels.</code>

              <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/IND/india-top-attractions-red-fort.jpg" alt="red-fort">
              <p>Built by Shah Jahan in 1648 as the seat of Mughal power-a role it maintained until 1857-the magnificent crescent-shaped Red Fort in New Delhi, named after the stunning red sandstone used in its construction, covers a vast area of more than two square kilometers, all of it surrounded by a large moat. Highlights include its two largest gates: the impressive Lahore Gate (the fort's main entrance) and the elaborately decorated Delhi Gate, once used by the emperor for ceremonial processions</p>
              <p>A fun part of a visit is exploring <b>Chatta Chowk</b>, a 17th-century covered bazaar selling everything from jewelry to silk garments, as well as souvenirs and food items. While you can explore the fort yourself, guided tours are offered and provide a fascinating insight into the life and times of the Shah, including a peek into the stunning white marble Hall of Public Audiences (Diwan-i-Am) where he received his subjects</p>
              <code>The Red Fort was Actually White!! It Took a Decade (or Ten Years) to Build the Red Fort.</code>

              <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/IND/india-top-attractions-periyar-national-park-wildlife-sanctuary.jpg" alt="madurai-wildlife-samctuary">
              <p>One of South India's most popular tourist attractions, Periyar National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary is centered around a lake built by British engineers in 1895 for irrigation and to provide water to the city of Madurai. Established in 1934, this beautiful park is home to numerous species of mammals, including a large free-roaming Indian elephant population, wild boar, otters, the lion-tailed macaque, and more than 20 Bengal tigers. Bird watching is a popular activity with frequent sightings of species such as darters, storks, kingfishers, hornbills, and racket-tailed drongos, along with many interesting varieties of butterflies</p>
              <p>The best ways to enjoy the park's splendid mountain scenery are to take a lake cruise or guided jungle walk, the latter allowing visitors a chance to come face to face with elephant herds and observe other wildlife from watchtowers and viewing platforms.</p>
              <code>The sanctuary is noted for herds of Asian elephants , sometimes having 50 members.</code>
